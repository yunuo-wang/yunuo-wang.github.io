## Other interest

Outside of academics, I am deeply passionate about art, having practiced painting since the age of three, with expertise in sketching, watercolor, oil painting, and traditional Chinese painting. I am also an avid diver, a collector of butterfly specimens, and a lover of science fiction, both as a reader and a writer. Additionally, I founded and led a music club with over 150 members.
