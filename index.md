## About Me

I am a senior undergraduate student majoring in Bioscience at the School of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). I have also had the privilege of participating in the International Guest Student Program (IGSP) at the University of Pennsylvania.

My research interests span the interdisciplinary fields of medical imaging, machine learning, and computational biology. Under the supervision of [Professor Weihua Chen](http://faculty.hust.edu.cn/chenweihua2/en/index.htm), I independently conducted metagenomic analyses on colorectal cancer datasets, identifying microbial biomarkers and developing robust cross-cohort predictive models. Additionally, under the guidance of [Professor James Choi](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/j.choi), I contributed to research on low-dose CT image denoising using GANs, exploring their potential applications in medical imaging.

I have been honored with several awards, including the prestigious China National Scholarship. Currently, I am preparing to apply for a master's program to further deepen my expertise and research skills.


## Research Interests

My main research interest lies on the intersection of computational methods and biomedical challenges, with an emphasis on integrating machine learning into medical imaging and biological data. I am particularly interested in disease prediction, image enhancement, and multimodal data integration. I am passionate about exploring how emerging technologies, such as Large Language Models and multimodal AI, can revolutionize healthcare by synthesizing diverse data sources.
